# Number Guesser

> A game of "hot and cold" with guessing a number.

> In the normal version, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 and the user has 5 guesses to pick the correct number. The computer will tell you if you are too high or too low.

> In the hard version the game is reversed and the user picks a number and the computer then has 5 guesses to select the correct answer.

> In the very hard version the computer's guesses are optimized to refine the range on the guesses based on whether they are too high or too low.
